## Helping out

`architect` is open source and we welcome your help making it better. Introduce yourself in the issue trackers or chat! &#x1f49e;

## Alternative solutions

If you are evaluating `architect` we also reccomend checking out:

- [this space intentially blank for now! norobots]

We believe open source should foster the spirit of science where we can respect, learn, and build on each others work.

There will be more than one way to provision and deploy cloud functions. The solutions listed above will meet some project and team needs better than `architect`.

## A very brief history

Naming things is hard. `architect` started out as `arc` which itself was an acronym for `Amazon run commands`. But mostly we just call it `arc`.

The code was developed building [Begin](https://begin.com) and granted to [JS Foundation](https://js.foundation/) in July of 2017 under the `Apache-2.0` license.
